ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.



There is only one reason you may be getting this error. You have PostgreSQL installed on your local machine and it's running, occupying the port 5432.

You have the following options:

    1) Disable (and remove from startup) PostgreSQL on your local machine. - Your Docker Compose will run.

    $ sudo service postgresql stop

    $ sudo update-rc.d postgresql disable

   2) Use a different port in docker-compose. There is nothing wrong with applying '5433:5432'. Other services of your docker-compose will connect to postgres by 5432 port. From your local machine you'll be able you address postgres by localhost:5433.



using postgresql
to show which one is run
$ sudo docker ps
run postgresql
$sudo docker run --name postgres-0 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=12345678 -d -p 5432:5432  postgres:alpine

to execute you can select the name  of  the running postgres and the bellow resource_db_1 is the name
$sudo docker exec -it resources_db_1 bash

use the username
/# psql -U postgres
now we are inside in the postgresql
see actual the user which we have
=# \du

for creating the database you can write
=# create database test;
for showing the databases
=# \l
to use  or connect the selecting database for example we use the test database
=# \c test

to conect to the local host
you can open your terminal and write
$ psql -h localhost  -p 5432 -U postgres
you can write your password to connect to local host i wrote myParola before
