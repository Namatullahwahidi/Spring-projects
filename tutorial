ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.



There is only one reason you may be getting this error. You have PostgreSQL installed on your local machine and it's running, occupying the port 5432.

You have the following options:

    1) Disable (and remove from startup) PostgreSQL on your local machine. - Your Docker Compose will run.

    $ sudo service postgresql stop

    $ sudo update-rc.d postgresql disable

   2) Use a different port in docker-compose. There is nothing wrong with applying '5433:5432'. Other services of your docker-compose will connect to postgres by 5432 port. From your local machine you'll be able you address postgres by localhost:5433.
